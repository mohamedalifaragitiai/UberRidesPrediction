# Uber Rides Prediction on Railway Data

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a predictive model for Uber rides on railway data, deployed using Flask. The goal of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to forecast Uber ride demand at railway stations, enabling more efficient resource allocation and improved passenger experience.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Model:** Utilizes a robust predictive model trained on historical data to forecast Uber ride demand at railway stations.
  
- **Flask Web Application:** Deploys the prediction model through a user-friendly web interface using Flask, allowing users to access real-time predictions.

- **Railway Integration:** Integrates seamlessly with railway data sources to enhance prediction accuracy by considering factors such as train schedules, station footfall, and historical ride patterns.
